\section{Background}
Last semester, we designed and implemented Felix: a system which measures
network traffic using NetKAT. Felix's query language and query compilation
design were complete, and a paper on Felix was accepted to SOSR. However,
both Felix and the SOSR submission were imperfect. First, Felix's query
compiler was slow for large inputs and would often crash on \emph{very} large
inputs. Second, the Felix compiler was not integrated with Haoxian's runtime
which made it onerous to run Felix end-to-end. Finally, our SOSR submission was
written hurriedly and submitted last minute\footnote{literally!}, leaving the
paper a bit incohesive.
